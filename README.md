### Hi there 👋

My name is Osama. I am currently a PhD Candidate in Computer Engineering at The George Washington University. I research in-memory hardware accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). 

I am interested in AI/ML research, hardware-software co-design, software engineering, and data science. 

Here are some cool projects I've worked on:

- 👨‍💻 [Neural Network Inference on an FPGA built using Verilog, high-level synthesis, and PYNQ](https://github.com/osama-usuf/fpga-inference)
- 🚗 [A reinforcement learning framework for the CARLA simulator built using Gymnasium](https://github.com/osama-usuf/GYM-CARLA-0.9.5)
- 🐜 [Visualizing the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm using Python Mode for Processing](https://github.com/osama-usuf/Interactive-Ant-Colony-Optimization-Simulation)
- 👚 [An e-commerce store web application integrated with an AI-based outfit recommendation system built using ReactTS, GraphQL, Django, PostGreSQL, and Tensorflow](https://github.com/osama-usuf/Kaavish-II-PORS)
