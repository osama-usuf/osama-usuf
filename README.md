### Hi there 👋

My name is Osama. I am currently a PhD Candidate in Computer Engineering at The George Washington University. I research in-memory hardware accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). 

I am interested in AI/ML research, hardware-software co-design, and software engineering. 

Here are some cool projects I've worked on:

- 👨‍💻 [A real-time handwritten digit recognition system running on an FPGA and served over the Web](https://github.com/osama-usuf/fpga-inference)
- 🚗 [A reinforcement learning framework for autonomous vehicles](https://github.com/osama-usuf/GYM-CARLA-0.9.5)
- 🐜 [Visualizing the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm using Processing](https://github.com/osama-usuf/Interactive-Ant-Colony-Optimization-Simulation)
- 👚 [An e-commerce store web application integrated with an AI-based outfit recommendation system built using ReactTS, GraphQL, Django, PostGreSQL, and Tensorflow](https://github.com/osama-usuf/Kaavish-II-PORS)

I also like to explore interesting ideas from AI/ML literature. Here is a list of a few of my implementations (actively adding to this list):

- [A Fault-Tolerant Neural Network Architecture](https://github.com/osama-usuf/A-Fault-Tolerant-Neural-Network-Architecture)
